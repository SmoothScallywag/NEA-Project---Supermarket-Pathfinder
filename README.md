This is my A-Level computer science project called Supermarket Pathfinder. The files are as follows:
- NEA Proposal Sheet - Supermarket Pathfinder: the proposal sheet which outlines what the project will do.
- Supermarket Items-2.db, Supermarket Items.sqbpro: the database files for the items.
- Supermarket Pathfinder Final Version 2.py: the program itself.
